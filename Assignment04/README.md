Here it is, finally!

the original video demo file is here, or, if you prefer, here is a link to it's you-tubed version:

I just now realized after finishing all of this, that I did not demo "un-hearting" a holiday..... I really don't want to re-do everything, so, I hope that is okay -- you can, in fact, un-heart a holiday!

Which, this app is "Stormy's Weird & Fun Holidays!"  
A collection of all of the unusual and amusing holidays we have in this country.   [=

Users can review the list of holidays (added by any user), "heart" their favorites and check out that list, and add holidays of their own for all users to see and enjoy!
